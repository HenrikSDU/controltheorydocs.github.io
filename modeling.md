In order to control a system, one needs to understand how a system behaves. This can be done best by the means of mathematical models of the system/plant that is to be controlled.

In control engineering there exist two main approaches to obtaining models of plants:
- Modeling in the Laplace/Frequency-Domain, using transfer function (Predominantly used in Classic Control)
- Modeling in the Time-Domain (Predominantly used in Modern Control)

Each of these methods brings different advantages and disadvantages. While modern control focusses mainly on time-domain modeling, the frequency-domain provides incredibly useful intuition.


# Basic Modeling of Electro-Mechanical Systems
Regardless of whether the model is obtained in the frequency-domain or time-domain, modeling usually starts by writing the governing equations of the system.
