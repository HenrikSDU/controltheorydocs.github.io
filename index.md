# Welcome to the Control Theory Docs
This is my personal project to build a quick look-up resource for control theory and related topics. I especially want to focus on the intuition of the topics, without sacrificing depth.

Planned content (For now):
- Modeling of Systems
    - Transfer Functions in Laplace-Domain
    - State Space in Time-Domain
- Classical Control Theory
    - PID
    - Bode Plots
    - and more
- Modern Control Theory
    - State-Feedback Controllers
    - Observers
    - and more

- Sensor Fusion and Filtering


- My courses this semester in control
    - Robust and Fault-tolerant Control
    - Adaptive Stochastic Control
    - Constrained Optimization?
    - Path Planning
